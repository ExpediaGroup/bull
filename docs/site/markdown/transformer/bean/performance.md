# Performance

This page shows the transformer performance for the following objects:

* Mutable objects
* Mutable objects extending another mutable object
* Immutable objects
* Immutable objects extending another immutable object
* Mixed objects

| | **Mutable**      | **Immutable** | **Mixed**       |
| :----------- | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
| Simple objects (without nested objects) | ~0.011ms | ~0.018ms | NA |
| Complex objects (containing several nested object and several items in Map and Array objects) | ~0.37ms | ~0.21ms | ~0.22ms | 
| CPU/Heap usage | [~0.2%/35 MB](docs/site/resources/images/stats/performance/mutableObject/jvmStats.jpg) | [~0.2%/30 MB](docs/site/resources/images/stats/performance/immutableObject/jvmStats.jpg) | [~0.2%/25 MB](docs/site/resources/images/stats/performance/mixedObject/jvmStats.jpg) |

## Real case testing

The Bean Utils library has been tested on a real case scenario integrating it into a real edge service (called BPE).
The purpose was to compare the latency introduced by the library plus the memory/CPU usage.
The dashboard's screenshot shows the latency of the invoked downstream service (called BPAS) and the one where the library has been installed (BPE). 
Following the obtained results:

| | **Classic transformer** | **BeanUtils library** |
| :----------- | :-----------: | :-----------: |
| Throughput per second | 60 | 60 |
| Average CPU usage | 0.3% | 0.3% |
| Min/Max Heap Memory Usage (MB) | 90/320 | 90/320 |
| Average Latency than the downstream service | +2ms | +2ms |

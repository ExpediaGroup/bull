# Third Party Libraries comparison

This page compares the Transformer functionalities with the following Third-Party libraries:

* [Apache BeanUtils](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-beanutils/)
* [Jackson Data Bind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind)
* [Dozer](http://dozer.sourceforge.net/)

## Functions

| | **BULL**      | **Apache Bean Utils** | **Jackson**       | **Dozer** |
| :----------- | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
| Mutable bean copy | X | X | X | X+ |
| Mutable bean with nested objects | X | - | X | X+ |
| Mutable bean extending classes | X | - | X | X+ |
| Immutable bean copy | X | - | - | X* |
| Mixed bean copy | X | - | - | X+ |
| Copy of beans without getter and setter methods defined | X | - | - | - |
| Mutable Bean with different field's name  | X | - | - | X+ |
| Mixed with different field's type | X | - | - | X+ |
| Immutable with different field's type | X | - | - | X+ |
| Mutable Bean containing collection type fields containing complex objects | X | - | X | X |
| Mixed Bean containing collection type fields containing complex objects | X | - | - | X+ |
| Immutable Bean containing collection type fields containing complex objects | X | - | - | X+ |
| Mutable Bean containing containing Map type fields with nested Maps inside.  e.g. `Map<String, Map<String, Integer>>` | X | - | X | X |
| Mixed Bean containing containing Map type fields with nested Maps inside.  e.g. `Map<String, Map<String, Integer>>` | X | - | - | X+ |
| Immutable Bean containing containing Map type fields with nested Maps inside.  e.g. `Map<String, Map<String, Integer>>` | X | - | - | X+ |
| Annotation field validation | X | - | X | - |

_[*] Immutable types are not supported by Dozer. When a type doesn't have a no-arg constructor and all fields are final, Dozer can't perform the mapping.
  Workaround is introducing the Builder Pattern. An example can be found [here](http://codeslut.blogspot.com/2010/05/mapping-immutable-value-objects-with.html)_
_[+] Requires a custom configuration_
